			"iOS engineer with deep experience in UIKit and SwiftUI. I bring a builder’s mindset, comfortable turning vague ideas into polished, production-ready apps. I value clarity in code, design, and process, and I avoid unnecessary complexity. Whether it’s shipping a new feature or architecting from scratch, I focus on what matters and build with intent. While my focus is on iOS Development, I also have experience with backend development using Node.js, which helps me see the bigger picture and build more cohesive products.",
